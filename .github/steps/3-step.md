## Step 3: Expand Calculator Functionality

Duck wants to expand the calculator with additional operations by creating a new issue and working with Copilot CLI to implement the enhancements.

### 📖 Theory: Iterative Development with Copilot CLI

#### Maintaining Momentum with Copilot CLI

The standalone Copilot CLI helps maintain development momentum by:

- Quickly generating code for new features using the latest AI models
- Suggesting best practices and patterns
- Helping debug and test new functionality
- Reducing context switching by keeping you in the terminal
- Handling long-running shell commands more efficiently
- Supporting improved automation with the headless `-p` mode

#### Delegating Larger Tasks

For more complex tasks, you can use the `/delegate` command exampled below to assign work to the Copilot coding agent:

> ```bash
> copilot
> ```
>
> ```text
> /delegate Add modulo, exponentiation, and square root functions to calculator.js with proper error handling
> ```

Copilot coding agent will:

1. Create a new branch automatically
2. Open a draft pull request
3. Work on the task autonomously
4. Stream output to your terminal
5. Request your review when complete

> [!NOTE]
> Using the `/delegate` command to leverage the Copilot Coding Agent (CCA) will consume premium requests from your GitHub Copilot subscription. Copilot CLI can be also used with regular models, which don't use premium requests.

#### Testing and Improvement Workflows

As you add features, Copilot CLI can help you:

- Generate test cases for new operations
- Suggest edge cases to consider
- Create documentation
- Refactor code for better maintainability
- Save and share your development sessions using `/share`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have restarted your codespace you may need to run `copilot --allow-all --enable-all-github-mcp-tools` and then authenticate with GitHub again by running `/login` from within the Copilot CLI session.

> [!NOTE]
> The `--allow-all` option in the Copilot CLI enables all permissions at once:
> it is equivalent to `--allow-all-tools`, `--allow-all-paths`, and `--allow-all-urls`.
> This allows the CLI to access any file path, use any tool, and access any URL without prompting for confirmation.
> Use with caution, as it grants the CLI full access and automation capabilities.

### ⌨️ Activity: Add More Operations to the Calculator

1. Start an interactive Copilot CLI session (if not already in a session):

   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terminal-text?logo=gnometerminal&labelColor=0969da&color=ddf4ff)
   >
   > ```bash
   > copilot --allow-all --enable-all-github-mcp-tools
   > ```

1. Ask Copilot CLI to help you create another issue for expanding the calculator:

   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLI-Prompt-text?style=flat-square&logo=github-copilot&labelColor=8250df&color=fbefff)
   >
   > ```prompt
   > Create a GitHub issue for a Node.js CLI calculator app using the feature_request.md template 
   > as the markdown format.
   > I want to request a feature to add more operations including 
   > - modulo
   > - exponentiation (power)
   > - square root
   > Create the issue directly for the current owner and repository in this session on github.com using the `gh` CLI commands.
   > List the issue link when complete
   > ```

1. Work with Copilot CLI to implement the new operations:

   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLI-Prompt-text?style=flat-square&logo=github-copilot&labelColor=8250df&color=fbefff)
   >
   > ```prompt
   > Add these functions to my existing calculator.js based on latest issue created:
   > 1. modulo(a, b) - returns the remainder of a divided by b
   > 2. power(base, exponent) - returns base raised to the exponent
   > 3. squareRoot(n) - returns the square root of n with error handling for negative numbers
   > ```

   1. Optional alternatively, use the headless mode:

      > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLI-Prompt-text?style=flat-square&logo=github-copilot&labelColor=8250df&color=fbefff)
      >
      > ```prompt
      > copilot -p "Add these functions to my existing calculator.js based on latest issue created:
      > 1. modulo(a, b) - returns the remainder of a divided by b
      > 2. power(base, exponent) - returns base raised to the exponent
      > 3. squareRoot(n) - returns the square root of n with error handling for negative numbers"
      > ```

1. Test your new functions and add tests:

   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLI-Prompt-text?style=flat-square&logo=github-copilot&labelColor=8250df&color=fbefff)
   >
   > ```prompt
   > Add tests for the new calculator operations: 
   > - Expand tests based on the following example:
   >   - @images/calc-extended-operations.png
   > - Add new tests for the new operations to the existing src/tests/calculator.test.js file
   > - Use a popular Node.js testing framework if one isn't installed
   > - Make sure to include edge case tests like square root of negative numbers
   > - Make sure all tests run and pass
   > ```

1. Commit your changes:

   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLI-Prompt-text?style=flat-square&logo=github-copilot&labelColor=8250df&color=fbefff)
   >
   > ```prompt
   > Add all calculator and test files to git.
   > Commit with message "Implemented additional calculator operations and tests: 
   > modulo, power, square root" 
   > Push the changes
   > ```

1. Wait a moment for Mona to check your work, provide feedback, and share the next lesson.

> [!TIP]
> Use `/share gist` in your Copilot CLI session to save your GitHub Skills exercise session as a GitHub gist for future reference!

<details>
<summary>Having trouble? 🤷</summary><br/>

- Make sure your issue title includes "Calculator" or "Operations"
- The calculator.js file should export functions that can be required/imported
- You can test operations manually using Node.js REPL: `node` then type your code
- For square root of negative numbers, consider returning `NaN` or throwing an error
- Remember to commit and push any code changes you make
- Use `copilot --help` to see all available command options
